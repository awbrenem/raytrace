Description of xplot.pro

This is a widget program that simulates both the f/t spectrograms from the
cluster spacecraft and the cross-correlation plots between two spacecraft
as simulated from Ivar Christophers cross-correlation program.

The data files that this program reads are stored in the path
/data1/awb/

You only need to manually read in the *.dat1 files.  The program reads in 
the rest of the appropriate files automatically.

There are two types of files you can load in.

1. time-type 1 (tt1). These are the straight up timing values of every ray
   created extrapolated to the grid points. Plot a bunch of these frequencies
   and you end up with a straight up Freq/Time spectrogram for one or more
   sc. Can plot up to two different Sc at one time. CANNOT USE THESE FILES
   TO MAKE A CORRELATION PLOT WITH 'Plot correlation'. You will only end up
   with the straight up timing values.

2. time-type 3 (tt3). These are the are the timing differences of the rays
   from the first sc subtracted from those of the second spacecraft, 
   for each frequency. Plot a bunch of these frequencies and you end up with
   a straight up cross-correlation plot between two sc. Can only plot
   the tt3 values for one Sc combo at a time. Ex. sc1-sc3 


Explanation of buttons in xplot.pro

'Find file (*.dat1)' - load *.dat1 files from /data1/awb/

'Read in files' - read in all the selected files 

'1-8' in vertical column - these buttons are selected to indicate which
files have been read in

'inc rays' - xplot.pro will only read in the ray paths if this button is 
selected. It takes a while to read all of them in and they are only 
necessary sometimes.

'1st freq' vertical column
'last freq' vertical column - for tt1 you can make time difference plots
between these two selected frequencies. This is to help locate areas where the
tt1 straight up timing values (from the 'Plot correlation' button) are 
desired. These buttons line up with the 'no file sel' buttons and are linked.
The only effect these buttons have on the 'Plot correlation' procedure is
to put the selected frequencies in red so you can tell which ones appear
on the upper plot window.  

'no file sel' - Select the appropriate read-in files for plotting. The selected
ones appear in the box on the RHS.

'Original zoom' - takes you back to xmin=3,xmax=5,ymin=-2,ymax=2

'Plot' - Plot the selected files with colorbar

'Single plot' - fills the top plot screen with a single plot so you can
click on the screen to select a location or to zoom in.

'Plot diff' - plots the delta-time values between the '1st freq' and 
'last freq' files selected.

'Single plot diff' - Same as above but fills screen.

'Plot correlation' - makes a correlation plot if you have loaded tt3 files,
or makes a straight up timing value plot if you have loaded tt1 files 
at the location you have clicked on in the top window. Must click on a location
in the 'Single plot' or 'Single plot diff' window for this to work. 
This procedure plots a value for every file loaded. 
Points plotted in red indicate the files you have selected for the difference
plot in the top window.

'Delta-time filters' - use to declutter the 'single plot' or 'Single plot diff'
so you can more easily select a region with a specific timing value.

'print to ps' - select this button and then push a plot button to make
a postscript file.

Zoom in - Click and drag the mouse on the upper window. Don't zoom in too far
     because the coordinate calculation looses accuracy.

Things to watch out for

1. If you want the straight up timing values for a number of 
   plots select the final frequency for both the 'first freq'
   and 'last freq' plot otherwise the plots will be cut off
   at the selected frequencies.
