How to compile the FORTRAN code trace.for

This needs to be linked during the compile to the TSY pack, which I've renamed
geopack_fortran.f

gfortran -std=legacy trace.f geopack_fortran.f


HOWEVER, THIS WON'T WORK UNTIL XCODE IS DELETED. 
To do this, first back up, and then delete /opt/local
This will allow the compiling to work. However, Xwindows won't work. So, compile the code, 
then unzip the backed up "local"


Can find the original package here: http://geo.phys.spbu.ru/~tsyganenko/modeling.html
Note that Ondrej's code calls "recalc". I had to change this to "recalc_08" as well as
three new dummy vars. Here's the change

Old:   call RECALC (IYEAR,IDOY,0,0,0)
New:   call RECALC_08 (IYEAR,IDOY,0,0,0,0,0,0)
